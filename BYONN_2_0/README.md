Build-Your-Own-Neural-Network-

This is a neural network builder for classifying digits built from the ground-up in Processing 3; I even made the matrix library. I am still working on an intuitive user interface with creating the neural network. For now the only way to change the dimensions or learning rate are through the .pde files themselves.

To load up saved weights simply place the desired weights in the directory told and rename the file to "weights.txt";

To save your weights, press S.

To pause your training or re-enable training, press T.

To exit just press ESC.
