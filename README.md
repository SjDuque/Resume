These are some personal projects I'm working on.

 BYONN 2.0 - Digit classifier programmed in processing from the ground-up. I even wrote the matrix math libraries. The application starts with pre-trained weights but you're more than welcome to just delete the weights and start new. I'm still working on the user interface so that the application feels more intuitive
