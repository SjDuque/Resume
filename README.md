These are some personal projects I'm working on.

 BYONN 2.0 - Digit classifier programmed in processing from the ground-up. I even wrote the matrix math libraries. The application starts with pre-trained weights but you're more than welcome to just delete the weights and start new. I'm still working on the user interface so that the application feels more intuitive
 
Snake AI - Game of snake with a twist: The computer plays for you. As of right now the snake game is built on a genetic algorithm. The AI is a bit finicky because the movement is absolute rather than relative to the snake, but I plan on fixing it soon.
